        <p>The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)[4] is a domesticated form of wolf. The dog descended from an ancient, extinct wolf,[5][6] with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[8][7] by hunter–gatherers more than 15,000 years ago,[6] prior to the development of agriculture.[1] Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior,[9] enabling an abundant cosmopolitan distribution[10] and to be able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11]
